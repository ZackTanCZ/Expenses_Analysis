# An Introduction into PowerBI - An Analysis of Expenses
The PowerBI Dashboard (PBIB) provides an overview of personal expenses, and breaksdown each category of expenses into varying levels of granularity. It analyses the spending habits of the user to gain some insight on the expenses incurred.  
The PBIB also act as a platform to learn and apply different skillsets (e.g. DAX, Data Modelling practices, ETL(using Python, Power Query & M) and answer various question about the user spending habits.
For Example,

* What is the total expenses til date?
* What is the average spending
* Which category incurred the most expense 
  

The PBIB consist of two pages of report. The first page provides an bird's eye view
