# Expenses_Analysis

## Short Description
This document outlines a personal project leveraging Google APIs for data aggregation and Power BI for data visualization.  Personal expense records are currently maintained across multiple Google Spreadsheets.  The Google API will be utilized to extract and consolidate these transactions into a single, unified data source. This consolidated dataset will then be imported into Power BI for visualization and analysis.

## Data Engineering
* Google Sheet API - The official Google Application Programming Interface (API) enables interaction with various Google services.  This document focuses on using the API to interact with Google Sheets as a data source. 
* gspread - gspread is a Python library that simplifies the process of interacting with Google Sheets.  Its purpose is to provide a user-friendly interface for reading, writing, and manipulating data within Google Sheets, abstracting away the complexities of the underlying Google Sheets API. 
* Google Colab - Google Colab is a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser.

## Data Analytics
* MS PowerBI - a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an easy-to-use interface for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.
