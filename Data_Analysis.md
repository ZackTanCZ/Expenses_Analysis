# Question by Gemini for PowerBI

That's a great way to learn Power BI!  Using your own expense data is perfect because you're invested in the results. Here's a breakdown of questions you can answer, categorized to help you build your Power BI skills progressively:

I. Basic Data Exploration & Summarization (Getting Started):

- [ ] What's my total spending for a given period (e.g., this month, last month, this year)? (Measures, DAX SUM function)
- [ ] What's my average daily/weekly/monthly spending? (Measures, DAX AVERAGE function)
- [ ] How much did I spend in each category (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment)? (Visualizations like bar charts, pie charts; grouping and aggregation)
- [ ] What are my top 5 expense categories? (Sorting, Top N filters)
- [ ] How does my spending vary by day of the week or month? (Line charts, column charts; date hierarchies)
- [ ] What's the distribution of my expenses (e.g., how many transactions are under $10, between $10 and $50, etc.)? (Histograms, bins)

II. Time Intelligence & Trends (Deeper Analysis):

- [ ] How has my spending changed over time? (Line charts, time series analysis)
- [ ] What's the trend of my spending in a specific category? (Filtered line charts)
- [ ] How does my spending this month compare to last month, or the same month last year? (DAX functions like SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATEADD; calculations of variance)
- [ ] What's my rolling average spending (e.g., 7-day or 30-day moving average)? (DAX functions like CALCULATE and AVERAGEX)
- [ ] Can I forecast my spending for the next month based on past trends? (While Power BI has some basic forecasting, this might be a good opportunity to explore more advanced techniques or integrations with other tools later on)

III. Advanced Analysis & Insights (Level Up):

- [ ] Is there a correlation between my spending in different categories? (Scatter plots, correlation analysis)
- [ ] Can I identify any outliers in my spending? (Box and whisker plots, conditional formatting)
- [ ] Can I create a budget and track my progress against it? (Calculated measures, conditional formatting to highlight overspending)
- [ ] Can I segment my expenses by different criteria (e.g., payment method, location)? (Slicers, filters)
- [ ] Can I drill down into specific transactions from summary visualizations? (Drillthrough functionality)
- [ ] Can I create interactive dashboards that allow me to explore my data from different angles? (Cross-filtering, tooltips)
- [ ] If you have multiple accounts, can you combine the data and analyze spending across all accounts? (Data modeling, relationships)

IV.  Power BI Specific Skills to Focus On:

- [ ] Data Cleaning and Transformation: Learn Power Query to clean up your expense data (e.g., handling missing values, changing data types, splitting columns).
- [ ] DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Master basic DAX functions (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.) and gradually learn more advanced functions (e.g., time intelligence, filtering).
- [ ] Visualizations: Experiment with different chart types and learn how to format them effectively.
- [ ] Data Modeling: Understand how to create relationships between tables if you have more complex data.
- [ ] Interactivity: Learn how to use slicers, filters, and drillthrough to make your dashboards interactive.
- [ ] Publishing and Sharing: Once you're happy with your dashboard, learn how to publish it to the Power BI service and share it with others.

Tips for Learning:

* Start simple: Don't try to tackle everything at once. Focus on one or two questions at a time.
